# pacman

This program is fully functional replica of the original Pac-Man game. to move around the board use the A,W,S,D keys. 
The game ends when Pac-Man is touched by a Ghost character. if you are experiencing difficulty exiting the game, push the x character on your keboard.
If a prompt does not appear, type "reset" to fully exit the game.

To run this file, use the command gcc pacman.c followed by the command ./a.out 

Thanks and enjoy!

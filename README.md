# pacman

This program is a fully functional replica of the original Pac-Man game. 
To move around the board, use the A, W, S, and D keys. 
The game ends when Pac-Man is touched by a Ghost or when all the dots on the board are eaten. 
If you're experiencing difficulty exiting the game, press the "x" character on your keyboard. 
If a prompt does not appear, type "reset" to fully exit the game.

To run this file, use the command gcc pacman.c followed by the command ./a.out.

Thanks, and enjoy!
